            After obtaining my Bachelors of Science from DePaul University - studying
            Computer Science - I split the summer working independently on full-stack
            development and assisting at a nursing facility. This website is the project. 
            It runs using Google Cloud as host provider, with the backend written in Rust.
            The purpose of this website is to primarily to provide information on my work 
            educational background, but I will include project examples as I take on more
            to reference my skills as a developer (PROJECTS section).
